## Introduction

This SDK is a client library for the Hammerspace REST API. It handles the details of authentication, request signing, and response parsing, allowing you to focus on building powerful automation and integration scripts for your Hammerspace data orchestration.

---

## Installation

You can install the HammerSDK using pip:

```bash
pip install HammerSDK
```

---

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example of how to connect to a Hammerspace Anvil, log in, and list the configured nodes:

```python
from HammerSDK.hammer_client import HammerClient
import os

# --- Configuration ---
# It's recommended to use environment variables for credentials
anvil_host = os.environ.get("HAMMERSPACE_HOST", "your-anvil-hostname")
anvil_user = os.environ.get("HAMMERSPACE_USER", "admin")
anvil_pass = os.environ.get("HAMMERSPACE_PASSWORD", "your-password")

try:
    # 1. Create a client instance
    # For development with self-signed certs, you might need:
    # client = HammerClient(anvil_host, verify="/path/to/your/anvil.crt")
    client = HammerClient(anvil_host)

    # 2. Log in to the Anvil
    client.login(anvil_user, anvil_pass)
    print("Successfully logged in to Hammerspace!")

    # 3. Use the SDK to interact with the API
    print("\nFetching list of nodes...")
    nodes = client.nodes.list_nodes()

    if nodes:
        for node in nodes:
            print(f"- Node Name: {node.get('name')}, State: {node.get('nodeState')}")
    else:
        print("No nodes found.")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

finally:
    # 4. The connection will close automatically, but you can be explicit
    if 'client' in locals():
        client.close()
        print("\nConnection closed.")
```
